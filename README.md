## üõ† Under the hood
The main reason to develop this app was to make it part of a process of learning both React Native and Redux. So it might be some things some experienced people could not agree in the way it is done, if you think so please fill an issue and become part of the process too!

Tools we're using:
* [`react-native`](https://github.com/facebook/react-native): Do'h!
* [`redux`](https://github.com/reactjs/redux) and [`react-redux`](https://github.com/reactjs/react-redux): State management and React bindings
* [`redux-thunk`](https://github.com/gaearon/redux-thunk): Thunk middleware for async actions
* [`redux-persist`](https://github.com/rt2zz/redux-persist): State persistance using `AsyncStorage`
* [`react-native-router-flux`](https://github.com/aksonov/react-native-router-flux): A nice Router (this might be an overkill)
* [`reselect`](https://github.com/reactjs/reselect): Memoized state selectors
* [`react-native-svg`](https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg): An SVG library
* [`react-native-vector-icons`](https://github.com/oblador/react-native-vector-icons): Vector icons
* [`react-native-keyboard-spacer`](https://github.com/Andr3wHur5t/react-native-keyboard-spacer): A keyboard spacer to shrink views when keyboard is being displayed
* [`react-native-debugger`](https://github.com/jhen0409/react-native-debugger): Awesome debugger

## ‚úäüèΩ Contribute
Once I reach a minimum set of features I would love to review and accept some PRs.
Consider the code is linted with ESLint and the configuration extends from [Airbnb style guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript).
As I said before, coding-style related issues are welcome (even if you think something is missing from this README!).
